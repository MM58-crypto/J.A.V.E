Dear Hiring Team,

I’m reaching out to apply for a Software Developer role at Elm. With experience developing conversational AI systems, containerizing applications with Docker, and conducting API testing and integration, I’m eager to contribute to Elm’s mission of delivering secure, innovative digital solutions. My background includes projects in Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and AWS, along with hands-on work developing web applications and streamlining deployment pipelines.

I’m particularly drawn to Elm’s role in shaping Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation, and would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and practical experience might support your teams. I’ve attached my resume for your review and would be glad to speak at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
